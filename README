* Edit input file inp.dat
  Set the test case as 20 (BLAST)
  In order to run a test case of your choice-
 -go to the source file init.c
 -scroll down to line 523 to function InitCondBlast
 -put in the values for primitive variables(rho, u1, u2, p)
 -go to line 79 and define the time for which the case is to be run
 -save and compile

* Compile the code

  cd 4vardgale/src
  make

* Run the code

  cd 4vardgale/run
  ../src/4vardgale

It creates three files

avg : contains cell average solution
sol : contains detailed solution
h   : contains cell sizes

* Plot the results

  gnuplot 'plot.gnu'
  open plot.ps

You can directly go to the sine-wave directory and 
  $gnuplot animate.gnu
to see a travelling sine wave which perfectly matches with the exact solution.
===========================================================================
OR
===========================================================================
I have also written 2 script files which automate some of this work and plot the results (plots or videos) 
*Edit the input files as above
*Compile the code
*Go to directory 4vardgale/run
*In terminal, type
  $chmod -x make-plot
  $./make-plot

This will run the code and plot the results. Similarly for make-video(files will be placed in directory 4vardgale/run/video).
